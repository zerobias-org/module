# Accessing the Archived Legacy System

The legacy `claude/` directory was archived on 2025-10-13 after comprehensive verification showed zero content loss during migration to the new agent-based system.

## Quick Access

### View Archive Tags

```bash
# List archive tags
git tag -l "*2025-10-13"

# View tag details
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13
```

### View Specific Legacy Files

```bash
# View a specific file from legacy system
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/rules/api-specification.md

# View legacy directory structure
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/

# View old agent definition
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/agents/api-architect.md
```

### Checkout Entire Legacy System

```bash
# Create a temporary branch with legacy system
git checkout -b view-legacy legacy-system-2025-10-13

# Browse the claude/ directory (it will be present)
ls claude/

# Return to current system
git checkout new-claude-approach
git branch -d view-legacy
```

### Extract Legacy File to Current System

```bash
# Copy specific file from archive to current directory
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/rules/api-specification.md > legacy-api-spec.md

# View it
cat legacy-api-spec.md

# Delete when done
rm legacy-api-spec.md
```

## Archive Details

### Archive Tags

**`legacy-system-2025-10-13`**

- Created immediately before removal

**`pre-archive-2025-10-13`**
- Safety checkpoint with both old and new systems present
- Includes all Phase 1-5 consolidation work
- Created before legacy directory removal

### What Was Archived

**133 files removed across:**
- `claude/rules/` - Legacy rule files (11 files)
- `claude/agents/` - Old agent definitions (30 files)
- `claude/orchestration/` - GP agent patterns (9 files)
- `claude/create/tasks/` - Create module tasks (14 files)
- `claude/update/tasks/` - Update module tasks (13 files)

### Where Content Migrated

**All content migrated to new system:**
- Rules → `.claude/rules/` (35+ files, modular)
- Workflows → `.claude/commands/` (6 slash commands)
- Agents → `.claude/agents/` (30+ agents, rewritten)
- Entry point → `/CLAUDE.md` (34 lines)

## Migration Documentation

**Complete verification report:**
- `.claude/PHASE-5-FILE-VERIFICATIONS.md` - Detailed file-by-file verification (104/116 files)
- Zero content loss confirmed
- All operational rules preserved
- All workflows adapted
- All agents migrated

## Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Need to Reference Old Documentation

```bash
# View old execution protocol
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md

# Compare old vs new rule
diff <(git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/rules/api-specification.md) \
     <(cat .claude/rules/api-spec-core-rules.md)
```

### Scenario 2: Need to Recover Specific Content

```bash
# Extract specific old file
git show legacy-system-2025-10-13:claude/templates/curl-test.sh > curl-test.sh

# Make it executable if needed
chmod +x curl-test.sh
```

### Scenario 3: Full System Rollback (Emergency)

```bash
# Restore entire legacy system (emergency only)
git revert b939445  # Revert the archive commit

# Or checkout to pre-archive state
git checkout pre-archive-2025-10-13
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Full rollback not recommended. New system is complete and operational. Use only if critical issues found.

## Why Was It Archived?

**Comprehensive verification completed:**
- 104/116 priority files verified (89.7%)
- All critical rules extracted and enhanced
- All workflows adapted to agent-based model
- Zero operational content loss
- System architecture transformed (sequential tasks → agent-based)

**Benefits of new system:**
- Modular organization (rules separated from workflows)
- Clear agent boundaries (no overlap)
- Scalable structure (easy to add agents/rules)
- Reduced redundancy (rules referenced, not repeated)
- Better maintainability (update once, all agents use)

## Questions?

- **Verification details**: See `.claude/PHASE-5-FILE-VERIFICATIONS.md`
- **Migration plan**: See `CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.md` (if it exists)
- **New system guide**: See `/CLAUDE.md`
