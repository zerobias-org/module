|---|------|-------|------|------------|
| 4 | CLAUDE.md | 303 | Entry Point | Replaced by new system |
| 5 | AI_WORKFLOW.md | 414 | Workflow Doc | → workflow-execution.md |
| 6 | CONTEXT-LOADING-PROTOCOL.md | 189 | Protocol | → memory-management.md |
| 7 | WORKFLOW-MAP.md | 760 | Meta Map | Distributed across commands |
| 8 | MIGRATION-MAP.md | 228 | Transitional | Consolidation tracking |
| 9 | SYSTEM-COMPARISON.md | 691 | Transitional | Old vs new comparison |
| 10 | BEST-PRACTICES-ALIGNMENT.md | 199 | Alignment | Distributed across rules |
| 11 | EXAMPLE-REQUESTS.md | 124 | Examples | May be in workflows |
| 12 | auto-load.md | 55 | Loading | Obsolete (agent system) |
| 13 | REQUEST-TEMPLATE-STRICT.md | 140 | Template | Obsolete (agent system) |

## Category Analysis

### Category A: Content Extracted (3 files, 603 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Content migrated to new system

| File | New Location | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| AI_WORKFLOW.md (414) | `.claude/rules/workflow-execution.md` | Workflow execution patterns |
| CONTEXT-LOADING-PROTOCOL.md (189) | `.claude/rules/memory-management.md` | Context/memory management |
| WORKFLOW-MAP.md (760) | `.claude/commands/*.md` | Workflow definitions distributed |

**Verification Needed:** Confirm content mapping

---

### Category B: Transitional Documents (3 files, 1,118 lines)

**Status:** ⚠️ Project tracking documents - not rule content

| File | Purpose | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| MIGRATION-MAP.md (228) | Tracks consolidation progress | Archive (no extraction needed) |
| SYSTEM-COMPARISON.md (691) | Compares old vs new systems | Archive (no extraction needed) |
| BEST-PRACTICES-ALIGNMENT.md (199) | Alignment documentation | Archive (content in rules) |

**Assessment:** These are **meta-documentation** about the consolidation project itself, not operational rules. They don't need extraction - just archive for historical reference.

---

### Category C: Templates & Examples (3 files, 336 lines)

**Status:** ⚠️ Likely obsolete in agent-based system

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| EXAMPLE-REQUESTS.md (124) | Example user requests | May be in workflows or obsolete |
| REQUEST-TEMPLATE-STRICT.md (140) | Strict request template | Obsolete (agents don't use templates) |
| request-template.md (72) | General request template | Obsolete (agents don't use templates) |

**Assessment:** Templates are not relevant in the new agent-based system where workflows define execution.

---

### Category D: Replaced Entry Point (2 files, 358 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Replaced by new system

| File | Lines | Replacement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| CLAUDE.md (303) | Old comprehensive guide | `/CLAUDE.md` (34 lines) - new agent system |
| auto-load.md (55) | Auto-loading rules | Obsolete (agents load rules) |

**Assessment:** Old system entry point replaced by new concise agent-based instructions.

---

## Verification Plan

### High Priority (verify content extraction)
1. ✅ AI_WORKFLOW.md → workflow-execution.md
2. ✅ CONTEXT-LOADING-PROTOCOL.md → memory-management.md
3. ✅ WORKFLOW-MAP.md → commands/*.md

### Low Priority (verify not needed)
4. ⚠️ MIGRATION-MAP.md (archive only)
5. ⚠️ SYSTEM-COMPARISON.md (archive only)
6. ⚠️ BEST-PRACTICES-ALIGNMENT.md (archive only)
7. ⚠️ EXAMPLE-REQUESTS.md (archive only)
8. ⚠️ Templates (obsolete, archive only)
9. ✅ CLAUDE.md (replaced)
10. ✅ auto-load.md (obsolete)

---

## Expected Verification Results

**Content Extraction:**
- Category A: Should find content in new system
- Category B: No extraction needed (meta-docs)
- Category C: No extraction needed (obsolete)
- Category D: Already replaced

**Total Content Loss Risk:** LOW
- Critical rules: Already extracted in Priority 1
- Workflow content: Has new system equivalents
- Meta-docs: Historical only, not operational
- Templates: Not applicable to agent system

---

## Next Steps

1. Verify Category A files (3 files) - content extraction
2. Mark Category B, C, D as "Archive Only" (8 files)
3. Complete Priority 2 verification
4. Move to Priority 3+ or Gap Analysis

**Status:** Analysis complete, ready for detailed verification
