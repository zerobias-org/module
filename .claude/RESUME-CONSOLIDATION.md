# Resume Consolidation After Compact

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete ✅

**Context used before compact:** 56.6% (113,260 / 200,000 tokens)
**Files created:** 7 new rule files with ~1,500 lines
**Progress:** Phases 1-3 complete, ready for Phase 4

## What Has Been Done

### Phase 1: Critical Rules Extraction ✅
- `.claude/rules/failure-conditions.md` - All immediate failure conditions
- `.claude/rules/validation-script.md` - Complete gate validation script

### Phase 2: Large File Splitting ✅
- Decision: Keep implementation.md and testing.md as comprehensive references
- They're well-organized with clear sections, splitting not necessary
- Agents can reference specific sections

### Phase 3: Missing Content Extraction ✅
Created 7 critical rule files:
1. **production-readiness.md** (152 lines) - Copied from claude/rules/
2. **git-workflow.md** (145 lines) - Copied from claude/rules/
3. **tool-requirements.md** (~200 lines) - All required tools, commands, validation patterns
4. **api-specification-critical-12-rules.md** (~400 lines) - The 12 critical API spec rules
5. **mapper-field-validation.md** (~300 lines) - Complete field validation workflow
6. **failure-conditions.md** (~150 lines) - Immediate failure conditions
7. **validation-script.md** (~100 lines) - Gate validation script

**Total extracted:** ~1,500 lines of critical operational rules

## Next Steps: Phase 4

### Update All Agents with Rule References

**Goal:** Add `@.claude/rules/` references to every agent in `.claude/agents/`

**Process:**
1. List all agents in `.claude/agents/`
2. For each agent, determine which rules it needs
3. Add rules to agent's "Rules to Load" section using `@.claude/rules/` notation
4. Ensure no agent overlaps (each agent has exclusive domain)

**Agent-Rule Mapping Strategy:**

| Agent | Core Rules Needed |
|-------|------------------|
| **api-architect** | api-spec-*.md, api-specification-critical-12-rules.md, gate-1-api-spec.md |
| **operation-engineer** | implementation.md, mapper-field-validation.md, gate-3-implementation.md |
| **testing-specialist** | testing.md, gate-4-test-creation.md, gate-5-test-execution.md |
| **integration-engineer** | implementation.md, error-handling.md, gate-3-implementation.md |
| **typescript-expert** | implementation.md, type-mapping.md, gate-2-type-generation.md |
| **security-auditor** | security.md, connection-profile-design.md |
| **build-reviewer** | gate-6-build.md, build-quality.md, tool-requirements.md |
| **product-specialist** | prerequisites.md, tool-requirements.md |
| **documentation-writer** | documentation.md |

### Phase 5: Verification and Archive

After agent updates:
1. Verify zero content loss between claude/ and .claude/
2. Create backup: `mv claude claude.backup-2025-10-13`
3. Test one workflow to ensure nothing breaks
4. Final consolidation report

## Files to Reference

- **Consolidation status:** `.claude/.consolidation-status.json`
- **This resume guide:** `.claude/RESUME-CONSOLIDATION.md`
- **Original analysis:** `CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.md` (root)
- **System comparison:** `claude/SYSTEM-COMPARISON.md` (detailed gap analysis)

## How to Resume

After compact, simply say:

```
Continue consolidation - Phase 4: Update agents with rule references
```

Or for specific work:

```
Update agents with @.claude/rules/ references according to RESUME-CONSOLIDATION.md
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Agent-Rule Mapping:** Shared rule files (multiple agents can reference same rule)
2. **Large File Splitting:** Deferred - keep implementation.md and testing.md as comprehensive references
3. **Meta-Docs:** Extracted operational rules, will archive original files
4. **Task Files:** Extracted most critical content, can add more incrementally later
5. **Scripts:** Keep as markdown examples (not executable scripts)

## Success Criteria

Consolidation complete when:
- ✅ Phase 1: Critical rules extracted
- ✅ Phase 2: Large files handled
- ✅ Phase 3: Missing content extracted
- ⏳ Phase 4: All agents have rule references
- ⏳ Phase 5: Zero content loss verified, claude/ archived

## Context Management

- Current work is at good stopping point
- All files saved to disk
- Can compact safely
- Resume will start fresh with Phase 4
