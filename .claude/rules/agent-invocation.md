# Agent Invocation Rules

## Invocation Syntax

Use `@agent-name` followed by the task:
```
@api-researcher Research GitHub webhooks
@api-architect Design the OpenAPI spec
```

## Agent Boundaries

- Each agent has EXCLUSIVE responsibilities
- NO overlap between agents allowed
- Check agent descriptions for triggers
- Respect "does NOT" boundaries

## Context Passing

When passing context between agents:
1. Save output to memory folder
2. Reference previous phase outputs
3. Include all necessary context
4. Use @.claude/rules/agent-parameter-passing.md

## Agent Loading

Each agent must:
1. Load its required rules
2. Assert its responsibilities
3. Check for prerequisites
4. Validate inputs

## Collaboration Rules

- Agents work sequentially, not in parallel
- Each agent completes before next starts
- Use memory files for handoffs
- Document decisions made
