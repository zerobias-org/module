### Gate 5: Test Execution

**STOP AND CHECK:**
```bash
# All tests must pass
npm test
echo "Exit code: $?"
# Must be 0

# No failures
npm test 2>&1 | grep -i "fail"
# Must return nothing
```

**PROCEED ONLY IF:**
- ✅ All new tests pass
- ✅ No regression in existing tests
- ✅ Zero test failures
- ✅ Coverage maintained or improved

**IF FAILED:** Fix failing tests before building.
