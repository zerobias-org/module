## Request Checklist

Before sending request, verify:

- [ ] Includes "STRICT ENFORCEMENT MODE"
- [ ] Lists pre-execution requirement
- [ ] Specifies exact file load order
- [ ] Mentions TodoWrite with all 7 steps
- [ ] Lists all 6 validation gates
- [ ] Includes failure triggers
- [ ] States completion criteria
- [ ] Emphasizes "DO NOT STOP UNTIL COMPLETE"

## What NOT to Say

‚ùå "Add operation X" (too vague)
‚ùå "Implement Y" (missing enforcement)
‚ùå "Create operation Z" (no checklist)
‚ùå "Can you add..." (not strict enough)

## What TO Say

‚úÖ Use the full template above
‚úÖ Include all enforcement language
‚úÖ List all gates explicitly
‚úÖ State failure triggers
‚úÖ Emphasize zero tolerance

## Remember

The stricter your request, the better the compliance.

Verbose enforcement > Concise flexibility

Every explicit reminder helps prevent:
- Skipped steps
- Missing tests
- Rule violations
- Incomplete work
