# Task 09: Create User Guide Documentation

## Prerequisites

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Before starting this task, read `CLAUDE.md` to understand the project structure, rules, and requirements.

## Overview

### 0. Context Management and Goal Reminder

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEP - CONTEXT CLEARING**: 
- **IGNORE all previous conversation context** - This task runs in isolation
- **CLEAR mental context** - Treat this as a fresh start with no prior assumptions
- **REQUEST**: User should run `/clear` or `/compact` command before starting this task for optimal performance

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY SECOND STEP**: Read and understand the original user intent:

1. **Read initial user prompt**:
   - Load `.claude/.localmemory/{action}-{module-identifier}/task-01-output.json`
   - Extract and review the `initialUserPrompt` field
   - Understand the original goal, scope, and specific user requirements

2. **Goal alignment verification**:
   - Ensure all user guide decisions align with the original user request
   - Keep the user's specific intentions and scope in mind throughout the task
   - If any conflicts arise between task instructions and user intent, prioritize user intent

3. **Context preservation**:
   - Reference the original prompt when determining user guide focus
   - Ensure the user guide addresses the user's actual needs and use cases

## Task Overview

Create a concise USER_GUIDE.md that focuses exclusively on two things:
1. Where to find credentials in the service
2. Which credential field maps to which connection profile parameter

Keep it short, clear, and to the point. No extensive documentation - just the essential mapping between service credentials and connection profile fields.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Rules

- **EXACT CONNECTIONPROFILE MAPPING** - Show exactly which service credential goes to which connectionProfile field
- **FIELD-BY-FIELD ACCURACY** - Every connectionProfile field must have a clear source credential identified
- **CONCISE ONLY** - No lengthy explanations - just credential location and field mapping
- **NO EXTRAS** - No troubleshooting, security practices, or additional sections beyond credential mapping
- **GENERIC EXAMPLES** - Never use "Zborg", "GitHub", or other specific product names in examples - use generic terms like "Module Access", "testuser", "{service_name}"

## Input Requirements

### Essential
- Task 02 output: `.claude/.localmemory/{action}-{module-identifier}/task-02-output.json` (connection profile)
- Where `{module-identifier}` is the product identifier derived from the identified product package (e.g., `vendor-suite-service` from `@scope/product-vendor-suite-service`, or `vendor-service` from `@scope/product-vendor-service`)
- `module_path` - Path to the module directory
- `service_name` - Service name in proper case

## Expected Outputs

### Files Created
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - Concise credential location and connection profile field mapping

### Memory Output  
- `.claude/.localmemory/{action}-{module-identifier}/task-09-output.json` - Task completion status

## Implementation

### Step 1: Analyze Connection Profile

**Load Task 02 Output:**
- Read Task 02 output to get the exact connectionProfile field structure
- Identify ALL fields that need credentials from the service
- Note the field hierarchy and types

### Step 2: Research Credential Locations

**Find Credential Sources:**
- Research where each required credential is obtained in the service UI
- Document the exact navigation path to find each credential
- Map each service credential to its corresponding connectionProfile field
- Include hidden HTML comments at the end of relevant steps suggesting where screenshots would be helpful (not visible in rendered markdown, positioned to avoid breaking list formatting)

### Step 3: Create Simple Mapping Guide

**Document Structure:**
```markdown
# {Service Name} Module User Guide

## Obtaining Credentials

### Where to Find Your Credentials
[Brief navigation instructions for each credential type with inline screenshot suggestions]

1. Step with navigation instruction <!-- Screenshot suggestion: Specific UI element or page -->
2. Another step with action <!-- Screenshot suggestion: Relevant UI screenshot -->

Note: Place HTML comments at the end of relevant steps to avoid breaking markdown list formatting

### Connection Profile Mapping
[Table showing: Service Credential â†’ Connection Profile Field]

```

## Output Format

Store the following JSON in memory file: `.claude/.localmemory/{action}-{module-identifier}/task-09-output.json`

```json
{
  "status": "completed|failed|error",
  "timestamp": "${iso_timestamp}",
  "userGuide": {
    "created": true,
    "connectionProfileFieldsMapped": "${mapped_fields_count}",
    "credentialSourcesDocumented": "${credential_sources_count}"
  },
  "files": {
    "userGuide": "${module_path}/USER_GUIDE.md"
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Every connectionProfile field from Task 02 has a clear source credential identified
- [ ] **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: All connectionProfile field names match Task 02 exactly
- [ ] USER_GUIDE.md created with concise credential location and mapping instructions
- [ ] Simple table/mapping showing which service credential goes to which connectionProfile field
- [ ] Brief navigation instructions for finding each required credential in the service
- [ ] Option 2 AI warning with proper formatting  
- [ ] Hidden HTML comments suggesting where screenshots would be helpful for visual clarity

## Template Structure

The USER_GUIDE.md should be concise with only:

1. **Where to Find Your Credentials** - Brief navigation for each credential type
2. **Connection Profile Mapping** - Simple table: Service Credential â†’ ConnectionProfile Field

---

**Note**: Keep the guide short and focused only on credential acquisition and field mapping. Include hidden HTML comments suggesting where screenshots would be helpful, but don't include actual screenshots or additional sections. Include user-facing AI-generated warning that will be removed after human validation.
