### Memory Output  
- `.claude/.localmemory/{action}-{module-identifier}/task-10-output.json` - Task completion status

## Implementation

### Step 1: Analyze Connection Requirements

**Load Previous Task Outputs:**
- Read Task 02 output to understand authentication methods and connection parameters
- Identify ALL credential fields defined in the connectionProfile structure
- Determine if multiple authentication methods are supported
- Extract base URLs, API versions, and other connection parameters

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: ConnectionProfile Field Mapping:**
- **MANDATORY**: Every field in connectionProfile MUST have corresponding user instructions
- **EXACT NAMES**: Use identical field names as defined in Task 02 connectionProfile
- **NESTED STRUCTURE**: Match the exact hierarchy (authentication.token, authentication.type, etc.)
- **DATA TYPES**: Respect field types and validation requirements from connectionProfile
- **OPTIONAL FIELDS**: Clearly mark which connectionProfile fields are optional vs required

**Credential Analysis:**
- Map technical parameter names to user-friendly descriptions while preserving exact field names
- Identify which connectionProfile credentials are mandatory vs optional
- Determine if credentials have different permission levels or scopes
- Note any special requirements (formats, restrictions, expiration) defined in connectionProfile

### Step 2: Create User Guide Structure

- **Content:** Screenshot showing {specific UI elements}
- **Annotations:** Highlight {specific buttons/fields} with red circles/arrows
- **Size:** Recommended 800x600 or larger for clarity
```

**Example Credential Steps:**
1. **Login and Navigate**
   - Go to {service_url}
   - Click "Sign In" and log into your account
   - Navigate to Account Settings â†’ API Access
   
2. **Generate API Credentials**
   - Click "Create New API Key" button
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Zborg Module Access")
   - Select appropriate permissions/scopes
   - Copy the generated key immediately

3. **Record Connection Parameters**
   - Note your account/organization ID
   - Record the API endpoint URL
   - Save any additional required parameters

### Step 4: Create Module Setup Instructions

**Environment Configuration:**
- Show how to create `.env` file
- Map credential parameters to environment variable names EXACTLY as defined in connectionProfile
- Include example values (sanitized/placeholder) matching connectionProfile field types
- Explain the purpose of each parameter using connectionProfile structure

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Connection Profile Setup:**
- Show the connectionProfile.yml structure EXACTLY as defined in Task 02
- **FIELD-BY-FIELD MATCH**: Every connectionProfile field must have setup instructions
- **EXACT HIERARCHY**: Preserve nested structure (authentication.type, authentication.token, etc.)
- **PARAMETER VALIDATION**: Include validation rules defined in connectionProfile schema
- Provide examples for different authentication methods supported in connectionProfile
- Include validation steps that verify connectionProfile requirements are met

**Example Section:**
```markdown
## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Create Environment File**
   Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```bash
   # {Service Name} Configuration
   {SERVICE}_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
   {SERVICE}_BASE_URL=https://api.{service}.com/v1
   {SERVICE}_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_org_id
   ```

2. **Configure Connection Profile**
   Update your `connectionProfile.yml`:
   ```yaml
   {service_name}:
     authentication:
       type: "token"
       token: "${SERVICE_API_TOKEN}"
     base_url: "${SERVICE_BASE_URL}"
     organization_id: "${SERVICE_ORGANIZATION_ID}"
   ```
```

### Step 5: Add Testing Instructions

**Connection Testing:**
- Provide simple test commands or scripts
- Show expected success output
- Explain how to identify connection issues
- Include validation steps for each credential type

**Test Commands:**
```markdown
## Testing Your Connection

1. **Basic Connection Test**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --grep "connection"
   ```

2. **Credential Validation**
   ```bash
   node -e "
   const client = require('./dist/index.js');
   client.connect().then(() => console.log('âœ“ Connected successfully'));
   "
   ```

3. **API Access Test**
   Test a basic read operation to verify permissions work correctly.
```

### Step 6: Add Troubleshooting Section

**Common Issues:**
- Authentication failures and their causes
- Network connectivity problems
- Permission/scope issues
- Configuration errors

**For Each Issue:**
- Describe the symptom
- Explain the likely cause
- Provide step-by-step solution
- Include relevant error messages to look for

**Example Troubleshooting:**
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Token" Error
**Symptoms:** Authentication fails with 401 Unauthorized
**Causes:** 
- Token copied incorrectly (missing characters, extra spaces)
- Token expired or revoked
- Token lacks required permissions

**Solution:**
1. Verify token is copied completely without extra characters
2. Check token expiration date in {service} dashboard
3. Regenerate token if necessary
4. Ensure token has required scopes: [list specific scopes]
```

### Step 7: Add Security Best Practices

**Credential Security:**
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use minimal required permissions
- Monitor credential usage
