### Connection Profile Mapping

| Service Credential | Connection Profile Field | Required |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Personal Access Token | `apiToken` | Yes |
| GitHub Enterprise Server URL | `url` | No |

**Notes:**
- The `apiToken` field accepts your personal access token from step 10 above
- The `url` field is only needed for GitHub Enterprise Server installations (leave empty for GitHub.com)
- For GitHub.com, the API automatically uses `https://api.github.com` as the base URL
