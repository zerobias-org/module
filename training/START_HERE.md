## 🤖 NEW: Interactive Learning Mode!

**Start Claude Code from this training/ folder for interactive learning!**

When you run Claude Code in the training/ directory, you automatically get a **learning companion** that:
- Guides you through chapters
- Answers your questions
- Shows REAL code examples with inline comments
- Creates quizzes and mindmaps
- Tracks your progress
- Uses easy letter navigation (a, b, c, d)

**Just ask**: "Help me learn module development!"

**See**: `HOW_TO_USE_LEARNING_ASSISTANT.md` for details

**Or**: Self-study with the guides below

---

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Keep Training and Production Separate**:
- **Training folder** (`training/`) = LEARNING only (questions, quizzes, practice)
- **Repository root** = PRODUCTION work (/create-module, /add-operation)
- **Don't mix them!**
