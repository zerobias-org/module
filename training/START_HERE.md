## 🤖 NEW: Interactive Learning Mode!

**Start Claude Code from this training/ folder for interactive learning!**

When you run Claude Code in the training/ directory, you automatically get a **learning companion** that:
- Guides you through chapters
- Answers your questions
- Shows REAL code examples with inline comments
- Creates quizzes and mindmaps
