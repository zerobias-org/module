## 📖 What's Covered

### The 8-Phase Module Creation Process

1. **API Research** - Test with curl, document structure
2. **Scaffolding** - Yeoman generator, sync-meta, install
3. **API Specification** - Design OpenAPI spec, connection schemas
4. **Implementation** - Client, Producers, Mappers
5. **Testing** - Unit (mocked) & Integration (real API)
6. **Documentation** - USERGUIDE.md with credential instructions
7. **Build** - Compile TypeScript, lock dependencies
8. **Validation** - Verify all 6 gates pass

### The 6 Quality Gates

✅ **Gate 1**: API Specification (12 critical rules)
✅ **Gate 2**: Type Generation (OpenAPI → TypeScript)
✅ **Gate 3**: Implementation (code quality, type safety)
✅ **Gate 4**: Unit Tests (mocked HTTP with nock)
✅ **Gate 5**: Integration Tests (real API with debug logging)
✅ **Gate 6**: Build (compilation + shrinkwrap)

**All must pass - no exceptions!**
